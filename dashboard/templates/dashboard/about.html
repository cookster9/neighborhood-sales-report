                    This website shows single family home sales in the past 6 weeks, grouped by neighborhood. I
                    found that Zillow and other sites had sales from too far back to be useful. Also it was hard to tell if
                    homes are in the same neighborhood or not on those sites. It came from a desire to see if the real estate
                    market is moving right now or not.

                    The data is scraped from padctn.org on a rolling basis. The dataset is fully refreshed about once a week.
                    I started scraping in May 2023, so that's my baseline.
