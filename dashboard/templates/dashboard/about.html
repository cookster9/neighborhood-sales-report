  <h1>About This Site</h1>
  <p>I wanted more recent view of home sales than what Zillow could show. <br>Also, I wanted something grouped by neighborhood.
    So I made this.</p>
  <p>The big icons are Nashville neighborhoods. Click them to get a list of home sales.
    <br>The smaller icons are the sold homes.</p>
  <p>The data is obtained from padctn.org on a weekly basis</p>
